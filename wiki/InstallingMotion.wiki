#summary How to install Motion on the OLPC.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

Since yum is intolerably slow on the OLPC and I haven't been able to find a good repository for packages, I hacked up a tarball for [http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome Motion] from the apt package on my Ubuntu Gusty box. It's available in the downloads section.

= Steps to build tarball =

  # Install the latest stable version of [http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome Motion].
  # Create a directory to store the tarball (i.e. {{{mkdir ~/motion}}})
  # Copy the libraries listed by {{{/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --list $(which motion)}}} into {{{~/motion}}}.
  # Use the {{{go}}} script in the motion tarball to start up motion with the correct {{{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}}.

~~I haven't been able to prevent motion from generating movies when it detects motion. Since space is at a bit of a premium on the OLPC, I set up a crontab to delete {{{/tmp/motion}}} every 10 minutes ({{{*/10 * * * * rm -rf /tmp/motion}}}).~~

The [http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#How_do_I_disable_or_enable_makin Motion wiki] explains how to disable generating movie files when motion is detected.

Also, I haven't been able to make permission changes to {{{/dev/video*}}} devices permanent even with changes to {{{/etc/udev/rules.d/*}}}. So, I run Motion as root.
